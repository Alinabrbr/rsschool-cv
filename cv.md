## About me ##


Six months ago I graduated from university and moved to another country. 
Frontend interested me because I can work remotely and constantly evolve. 
When I write code, I feel that I am doing something useful. And I can immediately 
see the results of my work. There is still a lot to learn, but I believe that my ambition, 
persistence and responsibility will allow me to become a frontend developer.
